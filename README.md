# Chatbot Projects – Data Science Internship (NullClass)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of three advanced chatbot tasks completed as part of my 4-month Data Science Internship at NullClass. The goal was to enhance chatbot capabilities with analytics, dynamic knowledge updates, and expert-level conversation using domain-specific data from arXiv.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. 📊 Chatbot Usage Analytics Dashboard
**Objective:** Track user interactions and extract key usage metrics.  
**Features:**
- Number of total chatbot queries.
- Most frequently asked topics.
- User satisfaction ratings (via feedback forms).
- Dashboard implemented using `Streamlit` and `Matplotlib`.

### 2. 🔁 Dynamic Knowledge Base Expansion
**Objective:** Periodically update chatbot's vector database using external sources.  
**Features:**
- Integration with web scraping or scheduled data fetch from pre-specified sources (e.g., articles, PDFs).
- Automated embedding and ingestion into `FAISS` vector database.
- Improved chatbot answers with up-to-date information.

### 3. 🤖 Domain Expert Chatbot using arXiv Dataset
**Objective:** Create a chatbot capable of answering advanced technical questions.  
**Dataset:** [arXiv Scientific Paper Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv)  
**Domain Focus:** Computer Science  
**Features:**
- NLP pipeline for paper summarization and key concept extraction.
- Use of open-source LLMs (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) for question answering.
- Streamlit-based GUI:
  - Search and browse papers by keyword/topic.
  - Get summaries and explanations.
  - Ask follow-up questions on complex topics.
